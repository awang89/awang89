I think it boils down to me liking the flavors alcohol can take on, but I don't actually like to drink all that much. I have probably 40 bottles stuffed around my house and most of them are closer to full than they are empty... but I digress.

Grapefruit syrup. Right. That's what I titled my post as.

I've been making my way through this rather neat book I picked up few months back - Cocktail Codex by Alex Day, Nick Fauchald, and David Kaplan. The ones known for their New York bar Death & Co. I haven't had a chance to visit the bar itself, but I am enjoying the book so far. It breaks down cocktails into 5 main categories - Old Fashioned, Martini, Daiquiri, Highballs, Flips. In between all the sections, there's some recommendations of liquors, liqueurs, and making some of the additional items that'll go with the drinks. At some point I found the section about syrups and with the remainder of a bag of Costco grapefruit sitting in my fridge, I decided to try making this grapefruit cordial.

The recipe goes like this:
250g grapefruit juice
260g white cane sugar
2.5g citric acid
10g grapefruit zest

Mix it all together and then cook in an sous vide for 2 hours at 135 deg F. Cool afterwards to room temp and then strain through a cheesecloth and mesh strainer.

I had two large grapefruit and no sense of how much zest 10g was. Let's just say, it's just about two grapefruits worth of zest. 250g of juice was about 1.5 grapefruits worth after I strained out the solids, and not having a sous vide likely resulted in a really syrupy cordial instead of whatever bright tasting syrup described in the book. I just heated it up on a low setting on the stove and let it warm up, dissolved all the sugar, and then called it a day when it seemed sort of warm. Close enough. I'll take it.

It's pretty good in tea. I should try it in a Paloma.

Instead, I made this cocktail listed on Imbibe https://imbibemagazine.com/homemade-grapefruit-cordial/ 

Solleone Cocktail
Grapefruit and Campari are a match made in cocktail heaven, especially when balanced by a botanical boost of gin.

2 oz. gin
1/2 oz. Campari (Luxardo Bitter will also work)
3/4 oz. grapefruit cordial
Tools: shaker, strainer
Glass: rocks
Garnish: grapefruit zest

Combine all ingredients and shake with ice. Strain into an ice-filled glass and garnish.


It wasn't bad, and I spent a while wondering why it needed to be in a rocks glass, but after trying it out, it made sense. The Campari comes through really strong and you can taste the grapefruit flavors on top of it, but it was a really thick, syrupy sort of cocktail. Not my favorite unfortunately. I think it had too much Campari. I used some St. George's Botanivore gin, so I got some of the herbal notes from there, but overall, I didn't like this drink all that much. I'd rather have a nice Negroni instead. A shame, but maybe a little bit of the cordial + the grapefruit bitters in a Negroni might work well. Maybe I'll try that next.

Or I'll make more grapefruit green tea.
