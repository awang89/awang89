Hello, I'm Andrea, and welcome to my website. I'm planning on using this to keep track of some of the hobbies and side projects I wind up doing. The organization of this page will probably need to evolve as additional categories are added, but here's some things I plan on posting about:

Track Days - Where I take my little s2000 and drive it around Nor Cal race tracks as quickly as I can
Fountain Pens - I've always loved stationery and collecting things. This just feeds into my compulsions.
Music - I've played piano for a long time, though I'm not the most disciplined or all that great at it. I'm out of practice, but I'll get my piano tuned soon. I hope.
Programming - These are for the side projects I do at home if I'm determined enough to finish them.
