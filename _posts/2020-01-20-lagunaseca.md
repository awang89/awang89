If there's any track i've been to a lot since I've started tracking, it would be Laguna Seca. Maybe because it's the closest, maybe it's because it was the first one I've ever driven on, but if there's any track that punishes small mistakes, this is the one. It's fairly straightforward. Gas, brake, turn, gas, brake, turn, but it's a fast track and the little mistakes will get carried along with you. Overbrake in turn 5 and you have no speed for the climb. Don't brake enough for turn 2, now you're barely making it back onto the line before turn 3 and a fast turn 4. Overshoot the corkscrew? Well, it's mostly paved so you'll survive, unless you're the guy who caught his wheel in the mud and flipped. 

It's probably the most famous of the Nor Cal tracks - Laguna Seca, Sonoma Raceway, Thunderhill Raceway Park. Close to the Bay Area, Laguna Seca's over between Monterey and Salinas, buried between the hills there. It's oftentimes foggy in the mornings with a low cloud cover and the cars echo through the paddock, but it's a lovely place to be. Laguna is also home to some of the strictest sound restrictions, with a typical sound limit of 90dB. For reference, the legal limit on public roads is 95dB. Some cars with a factory exhaust can definitely break sound. Ferraris, Vipers, Jaguar F-types... the list of sports cars that fail isn't short, and more or less anyone with a drivetrain modification will fail, so you get to see some creative methods of mitigating the sound measurement. (Search Laguna Seca Exhaust and you'll see)

Fortunately for me, I haven't made any modifications to my intake/exhaust, so the little s2000 doesn't have an issue there. I can go full throttle up the hill past turn 5 and not have a single worry about it, though the new ownership and sound calibration had me a bit worried last time I was there. Made it through without any issues though and hit my still off pace 1:47 personal best. Here's a little video of my run.

I'm still many seconds off of what the car can do, but I'm having a good time and am slowly getting better. Next is figuring out how to catch my car when it oversteers at 80 mph.

We'll see how that turns out.

Last time I hit a wall a Sonoma. Whoops.
